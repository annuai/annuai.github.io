# Annu.co

*To make a personal website that had oustandingly simple design, yet stands out as an awesome design had always been my dream and this is my try on doing the same.

## Whats it
This is not a source code.Its a compiled version of annu.co built using Jekyll.I will be uploading the whole source code once the work gets to a stable state.Currently i'm working on different features for the website and will require some time.

Meanwhile, the website is alive and running at [annu.co](http://annu.co)
