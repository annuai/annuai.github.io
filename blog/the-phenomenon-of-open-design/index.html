            <p>Design is not very new. In fact, Design is something human beings had been doing for centennials. But as we all are, human beings are generally very selfish and always want the product of their work safe in their hands. So they invented Patents. Although patents were actually meant to be used for increasing the reach and availability of innovations, it was always used the other way round.Patents had been used to preserve and completely stop someone else from improving a product that already exists in the world, patented by someone else. <br>
Patents were initially introduced in 1400s and it was only meant only to preserve the ownership of an innovative product, but nowadays even million-dollar multinationals fight against each other on silly patents, sometimes even leading to patent-wars. There are a hundred flaws on a system like patenting. We all live in an open world, but we are restricted from access to content everywhere. <br>
I am the kind of Aaron Swartz fan who believes all the information(let it be books, videos, code) in the world should be free and accessible to everyone equally. I know that is an ideal situation, but nowadays we see people coming forward to support the war Swartz started. <br>
 Open Sourcing is an even newer phenomenon only decades old.First used in Software than anything else, Open Source is all about supporting the thesis of free information being available to everyone.Open Source is the kind of system where people can reuse, modify or even innovate existing systems to better heights and still be free, so that someone else can innovate it even more.Open Source recently became a phenomenon of the 21st century.While Software Companies were fighting against the idea of Open Source in the 90s, certain companies like Google understood the real potential of a system being Open and found success in developing software world uses, like Android.
Design has a very important space reserved in the future.People have already started noticing that Design is not all about how something looks, but also about its functionality.But why there are not many Design innovations there is, I believe is because of the problem that it still follows the concept of something I make should be my Intellectual Property.There is not much collaboration happening in the Design Space.If someone makes a revolutionary Iron Box...it ends there, unfortunately.This is where the real potential of Design being Open Sourced can actually help.If someone Designs a revolutionary product and makes the Design Open Source.Someone else can still use the Design and innovate it even better.The Design reffered here is not just Engineering Design or Electronics, it can always also be Aesthetical, even Graphics or Interaction. <br>
People and Companies have started understanding that they can’t sell their product if it doesn’t work well with the User, nowadays.The product should adapt to the user rather than vice versa.Design, in that way is getting more popular by day.Product Design and Interaction Design - though in its early stages, compared to Communication and Graphic Design have already entered the mainstream where the usability is more concerned than the way something looks. <br>
Open Sourcing in Design has already started in some parts of the world and I’ve already seen Design Mentors like Prof.S Balram talking about Open Design as the future than others. <br>
I wish All the Design Work done in this world be free and Open, so the common man can also be a designer one day. <br>
