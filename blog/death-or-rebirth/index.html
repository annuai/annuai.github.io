            <p>As always, i am in a yet another critical situation.Now that I know i’m not creative enough to imagine where Life can take me.Two days back, I decided to quit College.Just an year after my Life at DJAD, it was actually starting to get interesting.But there are also a lot of other things that happen around things.While there were certain Interesting things, there were also the opposites - I failed at completing my tasks on time and eventually faculty starts thinking of me as an arrogant, good-for-nothing student , and found myself being in a loop situation - whatever I do, I will end up taking a repeat next Academic year. <br>
I’ll have to spend a whole year again to learn nothing.Don’t know why, Design Colleges work like that.You can do anything you want, but if you want to learn, you probably should take your laptop to the studio, start reading and start experimenting.But I don’t see that motivation in Class.Sometimes, the subject that Interested me the most in Life, feels like its boring.I don’t want to kill myself.I believe I still have the potential, and the best thing to do to not kill myself is to leave that over-exciting and amazing place. <br>
I have decided to take a chance - Of all that I have read and fed myself, chances are I will fail - Not even a probability, I will - but if I have the courage to get back up and keep going, I might end up good.And that is the most worrying thing for now.I don’t know if it will be death or rebirth.</p>
