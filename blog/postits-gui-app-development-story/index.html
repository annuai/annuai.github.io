        <section class="post-content">
            <p>From my little background in Design and my knowledge of the Design Process, I knew I should go through a bit of the process for this project as well, though this mainly was a Coding Project.</p>

<p>The first step in Design was the question "Is it really neccessary?". It was for me a necessity and that confirmed the need of the same for people across Linux'es. I had to find out where Post-its came from and why they had been invented. As it turns out from Wiki's I've learnt, Post-its were initially invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-it_note"><em>3Ms Scientist Dr. Spencer Silver</em></a> in 1977 as a use for the reusable adhesive he invented accidentally at 3M. 3M marketed it and initially, though it was a failure perseverence made Post-its one of the successful paper products known to the world, nowadays.</p>

<p>I had been using Post-its everywhere all through my Design School Life, and found it very important to have one for Linux, which always was my Primary Operating System. There was a Sticky Note Application for Ubuntu Unity available called <a href="https://launchpad.net/indicator-stickynotes"><em>indicator-stickynotes</em> by <em>Umang Verma</em></a> which had too many features and made it kind of unusable to me. I respect the work that Umang has put into it, but the UI still felt cluttered. Also it was broken in GNOMEs.</p>

<p>Now that I had time and had to do something, this was the way to go. I learnt I should do this because no one else probably will. There are not many Umang's out there, you know. Now that I had already learnt about the past of Post-its, I knew the way to go in creating this.</p>

<p>I still had doubts on which way to go. I had options in front of me, whether to choose the easy one or the other. The options were to use <a href="https://github.com/nwjs"><em>Node-Webkit</em></a> as my development platform, which wouldn't really need much of code and only need my HTML and JQuery skills to be implemented to it. But soon, I knew there will be drawbacks. Using a development platform like <em>Node-Webkit</em>, its not very suited for a desktop app to serve its purpose. These HTML based applications take more time to load than normal Applications and use more memory than the native ones. I already had some information about developing GUI applications for Linux, especially the tools and Languages in use, but never knew how to use them.</p>

<p><em>Node-Webkit</em> would just make it work, it was filled in with features, but its drawbacks in serving the purpose I required, made me step back from doing it the Node way. I decided to search for other tools and Languages.</p>

<p>Python was next. Umang had used Python as the language for his project <em>indicator-stickynotes</em>, mainly the reasons would've been Python is easy to code in, has a long lot of libraries available and would do the job pretty well. Python was the best option. Being in 25 years of existence, it was already well documented and supported.</p>

<p>I didn't start with Python just like that though. I learnt Python from <a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> and other tutorials at first, and wished these would help me do what I really wanted. I was good enough to complete the Python Course in an hour. But that was not the reality - I was being assisted and all I had been thought was beginner-level Programming.</p>

<p>I knew Gtk was my GUI tool to go with, it was the Platform used my almost all of the Applications developed for GNOME. The best thing about it was, it worked and it was filled with features, that if used properly could end you up in developing Amazing Applications in not too much Code.</p>

<p>Then Came a turning point, I found out a relatively newer language that was in use. It had been in development and is still in development and was called <em>Vala</em>, Voila!<br>Vala had almost everything I needed for this purpose. Vala is basically a language that in the end Compiles into C Code, which is the native language used by GNOME and Linux itself. That just meant it was 10 times faster than Python(though it never mattered) and was better with Gtk, since it was written to work alongside Gtk.</p>

<p>Vala was relatively Simpler than C but tougher than Python. It was Java-ish. A week into it, I never fell in love. It was a bit too difficult for me and it was different. But Perseverence did take people to the next level, so did I.<br> Another Week later, I had a GUI made in a Gtk UI development tool called Glade. I could make the UI work, but didn't how to put my ideas in practice.</p>

<p>A While later, I found out Vala barely had any documentation available, the website was not working Properly and StackOverflow didn't have much in there on Vala. A little more later, I started solving out the simpler problems and also found out a way to use the <a href="http://valadoc.org"><em>Valadoc</em></a> website, which is unusable for a common user, in its present state(try using the search option).  </p>

<p>It took me a while to learn Vala and for now...with a lot of not so good code, in its early development stage, it does work. The next problem did surface soon enough, How to store data! I did find a solution...</p>

<p>I never knew how to Design Applications in the backend level, you can help me if you know, just drop me an <a href="mailto:annuai.annu@gmail.com">Email</a></p>

<pre><code>First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.
</code></pre>

<p>Updates Soon.</p>
