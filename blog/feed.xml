				<title>A Refresh to indicator-stickynotes</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;I love good looking apps.As a budding UI designer, I should.I was a chronic user of Sticky Notes on Windows, when I had been a Windows User.Sticky Notes helped me save a lot of paper and got me to memorize my things in time.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Premam - A review by a novice</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/FvgP55i.jpg&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;
The new movie in town had been hitting hundreds all week long.Premam by Alphonse Putharen is not really a one-of-a-kind movie at all.But, it still packs a whole lot of punch in the package.It has something for everyone - and that is what makes the movie a real good one.&lt;/p&gt;
