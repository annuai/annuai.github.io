To Study Design had always been a dream to me, now that I have completed Secondary Education, it is the right time to start my Higher Education and Specialisation.Design is now a globally acknowledged subject.From the beginning of man, although unintentionally he had been using simple design techniques to simplify his tasks.</p>

<p>From the important invention of Wheels to the invention of  Space Ships, design had always been a very important aspect. <br>
In the modern world thereby, Design becomes an important subject of attention.Today Computers are everywhere, and we do a lot of things using them.We use a Computer in almost every single instance of our present lives. In an ATM or a Ticket Printer to a Mobile Phone or even a Super Computer that process large amounts of Data.</p>

<p>Although, from its invention to present, they've come a long way from Command Line to GUI and is now trying to invent the next best Interface, they are mostly not enough.Just as S.Balaram, the author of Thinking Design and Dean at my College D.J.Academy Of Design has said - even pollution and wastage of fuel are traits of the vehicle's design, the incomplete interaction between human and Computers is also an inefficiency in GUIs Design.I would study in the coming four Academic Years, about Product Design - the way day to day products are designed and produced and I would like to specialize myself in Interaction Design - the way we interact with things, like Machines around us.</p>

<p>I know I have said a lot of things, unrelated to my emotions.Day After Tomorrow is my first day at College.I'm very nervous of what is life going to be like in there.I have never left my parents for more than 2 days.I'll have to wash my clothes and Iron myself.All new to me.Also, I wish no senior makes me dance.I'm nothing more than a student at the college as of Monday.All that I know of is I'll have to spend four years of my life in there.I'm thrilled about so many things, just like i'm afraid of many others.</p>

<p>I'm excited that I'll learn a new language, know about a new culture and study one of my favorite subjects over time.But still, I'm worried that I don't have much skills - I'll have to produce them from the ground up, Teachers would be as horrible as my HSC, and much more.I can only hope it won't be like that.</p>

<p>Let me just hope, people aren't so mean to me and I have a lot of friends, even seniors.Although I won't be the coolest, I can still be Cool Enough.<br> <br>
With Hope that I won't Become a Laughing Stock.<br> <br>
Let it be a A New Beginning.</p>
