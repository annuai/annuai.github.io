Can you predict a Number from a not-so-specific set of rules that eventually leads to an answer. You can - because your Brain is a Neural Network(A set of 10 billion Neurons connected by at least 10,000 synapses(connectors) from and to each Neuron), it can store data and retrieve the same as usual Computers do, but also use the same data without another command in another operation, all of which are parallel and done in fractions of a second. <br>
If that sounds complicated, your Brain can predict numbers with experiences - It need not be given set of rules to generate the predictions. <br>
Computers, on the other hand are only millions of calculators with a Very Large Scale integration in action inside a Microchip(as of now - read about Quantum Computers for the future). They can never reproduce a random number from Experience...it has no experience at all. <br>
This was the basic question that I started on, how to generate Random Numbers in a Computer. <br>
Random, by definition means "made, done, or happening without method or conscious decision", which can never happen with a Computer itself. A Computer in its most basic form is only useful to do basic Mathematical Operations - using Addition, which can't be used to generate a Random Number.But if Random Numbers can't be generated, that just means a million applications we use computers for nowadays aren't feasible.So, there are ways to achieve randomness in a Computer.But the problem is, it can never be random - it should and will always follow a specific set of rules and certain variable inputs to generate the Number, which can be relative to time(because it is changing) or any real-time unpredictable data. <br>
So I searched for algorithms, which could do the same and found out there are different type of random numbers - True Random Numbers and Pseudo Random Numbers.True Random can be generated with real-time completely unpredictable data happening, a very basic(not popular - not at all secure either) example being the temperature of your CPU (since it can't be controlled). A Pseudo Random number doesn't use real-time data, it can save time, but is not as secure as True Randoms. <br>
Random Numbers are very important in the real world. There are more applications to completely random numbers than you ever thought(which I found out only recently).Quality Pseudorandom number generation forms the bedrock on which all of computing is built. From cryptography to financial markets to particle physics, it is our trust in random numbers that props up the modern economy and allows technology to march forth, unabated <br>
Respect Numbers, especially Random ones :P <br>
I was jobless to write this.</p>
