            <p>Just an Opinion. <br>
We all are surrounded by people who want you to think outside the box - especially when you are in a Design College. Now that I am capable enough to think of what i am thinking, I had to find out what the phrase actually meant. I didn’t have to go through a whole Design Process to find out what that actually meant. The answer was always around me. <br>
What do people mean by saying ‘Think Outside the Box’? <br>
Well, It just means to f**k the conventions and think outwards of the Circle of Life you are in. But what exactly does it do when we think outside the Box - Nothing. You might come up with some innovative ideas if you do so, but do you actually try to implement and how many people get those ideas, not many. <br>
Now what I needed was to know where this was box kept and how big it was, so that I know when I am thinking outside the box. But it is all only the same thing. You use your Right brain for Creative Ideas - but those ideas are only a product of your past experiences. You have the box called Brain and you have to think outside of it. <br>
Unfortunately, you can’t - your brain is a hard-wired machine that can only think of what it already knows in a million probable ways. To be short - just another Super Computer(only with a million times more power and very advanced machine learning in practice - what I think it is). <br>
So how do people arrive at the phrase ‘Think Outside the Box’? It’s simple - It’s just a combination of basic English words that has meaning. So it’s not very difficult to create a sentence, that might even confuse people. <br>
But our brains are hard-wired to follow conventions - Can you imagine stuff only you can imagine. Out of 7 Billion, it is true that the idea you just had, had been in the minds of at least another hundred people. Even if you think you are a creative, all that you can do is use your skills - that you’ve developed by practice. You never will have an Original Idea, and you have to live with the fact in mind. <br>
Also, why do you need to think outside the box - what is the use of a new idea when there are a billion problems to be solved here in this world. Maybe that is how the world works, but that is not my point of view. New Concepts are not what we need, but new solutions - the instant ones that can sustain are what we actually need. <br>
We need to think inside the box, rather than trying and failing at thinking outside the box. I will tell you - not thinking at all is better than trying to Think outside the box. <br>
Please don’t be confused. You only need to Think inside your own Brain to understand what I just said. Your Brain is as powerful as a hundred Super Computers Combined, so you can find amazing solutions from the experiences you already have - the simple ones. Those Simple, Practical Solutions are what the world needs and not those so-called revolutionary ideas, while both does actually the same. You can at least save some time that way I hope. <br>
Just Start to Think Inside your own Brain, or else Don’t Think at all.</p>
