            <p>Been a long time since I wrote something. Had kept a promise to myself to not stop writing again, but had to - given the situation I was in.</p>

<p>A hard time May was, I had a lot of things planned, none of them which worked out. It was a plan to get into some college for a Major in Psychology, which hasn't happened yet. It was another plan to get into <a href="http://geekskool.com">geekskool</a> (a coding school in Bangalore), but never had the skills to. Well, it wasn't a complete turndown though - As always there is something good about everything bad.</p>

<p>I had been working on different personal projects in the past month - especially a Vala Gtk Coding Project. Although I boast out proud that I am a programmer for Life, I had never been. Being Frank, all I knew was HTML and CSS. Not long ago I decided I should be doing something that improved my skills in both Design and Coding fields.</p>

<p>Sometime back, I started my own project of bringing a Post-it note application to Linux Platforms, something I loved using on Windows, but never existed on Linuxes except KDE Desktop(that too very much cluttered). </p>

<p>I found out all Unixes are not very user-friendly, even the GUIs. The coders working behind them are backend engineers, all they would do is add a feature and add a button to it - something that annoys the daily user. There is not much research that goes into UX Design in Linux Development - After all, there is a reason why Linux'es are not very popular among daily users. When <em>Elementary OS</em> came out, it was a bless - an Operating system that simplified almost every daily task a Windows User would perform - still in development, elementary didn't get much popularity than among the developer community. It even had a style of its own, which made the UX more uniform and simple.</p>

<p>Ubuntu, the Operating System that holds around 50% of the daily-user base is the most popular Linux Operating System in use, nowadays. The kind of development going on with Canonical is very good - in fact, most of the backend code is very stable and on par with Windows Systems, might even be better - but they never cared about UI and UX, most of the Applications used are older versions from the GNOME Project.</p>

<p>GNOME is the one thing I love in Linux'es.Though it had very humble beginnings as an App and Desktop Environment development project, it turned out to be one driver that made the best of what we see on Linux Desktops nowadays. It's not been since some very good UI designers (I won't say UX), came into action for GNOME and it's been a hundred times better since then. From saying I hate Linux GUI, I started saying GNOME is good enough nowadays.</p>

<p>GNOME devs had been busy developing and maintaining the Applications they already have, they might not get time enough to make new ones. I knew I had to do something to the open Source world, so I decided one day, why not fix the problem of not having a <em>Post-it-Notes</em> GUI application for <em>Linux GUI</em>s.</p>

<p>I don't have  much of a Coding background, all I know is what I learnt from the Wide World of Web. So I started researching and it went on for short streaks for 1-2 weeks.</p>
