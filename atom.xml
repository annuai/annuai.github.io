   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had been doing a programming course that I had enrolled for during my school days for the vacation.it had been extended a lot of times until it started on 20th of  last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a real good time for the 37 days I spent there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a short course, I have learnt a lot of things.I have new friends to call up for movies and much much more in life than it had been before.Fortuantely, iâ€™m happy that this post ended up to be my first blog post in my personal blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript, the main lesson was what I was thought all the way along.Though I knew(sincerely) most of it, it was still interesting to learn with those awesome guys and girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary, my teacher - weird only by her name had been the friendliest of teachers in my life.I will miss all those people from today - But as it always happens, life has to move on and it surely will.
