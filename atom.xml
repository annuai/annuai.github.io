   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The new movie in town had been hitting hundreds all week long.Premam by Alphonse Putharen is not really a one-of-a-kind movie at all.But, it still packs a whole lot of punch in the package.It has something for everyone - and that is what makes the movie a real good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical Coming-Of-Age film with some twists and turns in the middle, that is the one-line explanation of this movie.
The plot is set around three love stories of George, played by Nivin Pauly mostly during his teenage.George falls in love with three women of different proportions - Mary, Malar and Celin and the film has a happy ending that commences in a marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot of the movie is something very similiar to the typical teenage life of a 17 year old, who gets shaped into a man in due course of time.Nivin Pauly, as usual has made his part excellent.His role as George is what shapes the whole film and Nivin gets a good applaud for his effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alphonse Putharen have introduced three new female leads for the film, who come and go out at certain places, and their excellent performances in the movie is worth mention.Sai Pallavi - one of the debutants, who plays the role of Malar, a College Lecturer in the film had an outstanding performance.Sai has shown both her Acting and Dancing skills in the film, and doesn’t look anything like a debutant at all.The hiked out role of Mary - the school girl, has only a small role to play in the film, and those Mary fans who went into the Cinema comes out as Malar fans.Celine, played by Madonna Sebastian also plays a small role, but gives the audience an excellent perfomance.The comedy in the film is also so very simple and never misleading and the movie also gets an applaud for Alphonse Putharen’s excellent writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The songs have a timely feel and the Rajesh Murugesan has done his part great with the already hit songs of the film. The cinematography by Anand C. Chandra is the next best thing to be praised for in the film.By adopting to situations, the film has a cool feel overall and gets its highs and lows all at the perfect timings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Premam is a typical entertainer, it has everything to entertain anyone for 160 minutes.Though the last half seems a bit complicated and sometimes unwanted, it still doesn’t ment the overall feel.It can also be called a comedy entertainer, mainly because most of the things in the movie ends up people laughing out loud.It is in fact, a yet another Thattathin Marayathu or Om Shanti Oshana, with a lot of goodness packed inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are one of those who want a real good movie this weekend, just go out for Premam, you’ll surely end up happy after seeing the story of George and his love’s and would want more.I’m already thinking of visiting the Movies again for a rewatch.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had been doing a programming course that I had enrolled for during my school days for the vacation.it had been extended a lot of times until it started on 20th of  last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a real good time for the 37 days I spent there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a short course, I have learnt a lot of things.I have new friends to call up for movies and much much more in life than it had been before.Fortuantely, i’m happy that this post ended up to be my first blog post in my personal blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript, the main lesson was what I was thought all the way along.Though I knew(sincerely) most of it, it was still interesting to learn with those awesome guys and girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary, my teacher - weird only by her name had been the friendliest of teachers in my life.I will miss all those people from today - But as it always happens, life has to move on and it surely will.
